                <div className='careeradvice-title'>How to Introduce Yourself in an Interview</div>

                <div className='careeradvice-subtitle'></div>

                <div className='careeradvice-content'>We have all attended interviews of some sort in our lives, haven’t we? </div>
                <div className='careeradvice-content'>When it is a job interview, the significance can make it seem frightening for freshers. Forget freshers, the chance  of one can unnerve even seasoned professionals at times. But it doesn’t need to be so.</div>
                <div className='careeradvice-content'>A job interview, if approached in the right manner, can be very straightforward. While the job role and your knowledge are important factors in an interview, nothing makes more of an impression than your self-introduction. It is a critical part of the interview. But it is also a part you can ace if you prepare well.</div>
                <div className='careeradvice-content'>We’ve put together some tips for you that will make introductions in interviews a fairly simple affair.</div>

                <div className='careeradvice-subtitle'>1. Dress appropriately</div>

                <div className='careeradvice-content'>When meeting someone new, especially for a job interview, appearance is crucial. Before you introduce yourself, the interviewer forms the first impression after observing your attire. Before you go for the interview, do some research on the firm and try to understand how formal (or informal) their dress code is. Here are a few pointers:</div>
                <div className='careeradvice-content'>Be true to yourself: What you wear is a part of what you are. Use your dress to express your personality. Avoid distracting outfits: To guarantee that the interviewers pay attention to what you say, eliminate distracting stuff such as expensive jewellery or glaring colours and prints. Be comfortable: Though you are supposed to dress professionally, make sure you feel comfortable in your clothes. </div>

                <div className='careeradvice-subtitle'>2. Prepare what to say</div>

                <div className='careeradvice-content'>Prepare what you are going to say in your introduction in advance. While introducing yourself, make a strong first impression by confidently stating your name. You do not have to shout your name but be clear when you say it. The tone of your response demonstrates that you are confident and eager about the job prospect. </div>
                <div className='careeradvice-content'>Don’t worry if you feel nervous or are unsure about how confidently you can say your name. Practise with some friends or family before you attend the interview. </div>

                <div className='careeradvice-subtitle'>3. Begin by greeting the interviewer</div>
                <div className='careeradvice-content'>Greeting the interviewer(s) is an essential element of the interview process. Always start the self-introduction by greeting the interviewers. It allows them to measure your level of confidence. Remember to smile. After greeting the interviewer appropriately, say your full name. Then give a brief description of your family. While doing so, don’t be nervous and look away while speaking. Always maintain eye contact with the interviewers. </div>

                <div className='careeradvice-subtitle'>4. Include your educational qualifications</div>
                <div className='careeradvice-content'>Once you’ve given a basic introduction, including your name and family information, tell the interviewers about your educational background. Even though your resume would have it, you should provide details on the courses you undertook and the institutions where you studied. Be honest when discussing your academic achievements. Try to be factual and avoid seeming overconfident. </div>

                <div className='careeradvice-subtitle'>5 Elaborate on professional experience (if any)</div>
                <div className='careeradvice-content'>In the case of experienced candidates, it is essential to discuss all the specifics of your previous work experience. Begin with the name of the company where you’ve been working.</div>
                <div className='careeradvice-content'>Mention your designation as well as the time frame. Always try to highlight if you had been promoted while at the same company. </div>
                <div className='careeradvice-content'>Try to mention the projects you worked on and your role in them. Make sure to prepare some points on the difficulties you’ve encountered and how you overcame them since it could be a very common follow-up question from the interviewers.</div>

                <div className='careeradvice-subtitle'>6 Mention your hobbies and interests</div>
                <div className='careeradvice-content'>Your self-introduction does not have to be entirely formal. Don’t be afraid to switch to a more casual tone and talk about your hobbies and interests, both professionally and personally. Be careful not to go too casual. Always maintain the substance of the interview.</div>

                <div className='careeradvice-subtitle'>7 Be prepared for follow-up questions</div>
                <div className='careeradvice-content'>Hiring managers ask follow-up questions to assess your honesty and integrity. A sequence of questions based on what you said in the introduction can reveal whether you were being truthful. Thus, when introducing yourself at the interview, try to be as sincere as possible. Practice answering follow-up questions beforehand.</div>
