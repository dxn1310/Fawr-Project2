                <div className='careeradvice-subtitle'>What are part-time jobs?</div>
                <div className='careeradvice-content'>A part-time job requires a worker to work fewer hours each workweek than what a usual full-time employment demands. Students, mothers, retired people, and other individuals who don’t like to commit to full-time employment are examples of part-time workers. Some people may also work two or more part-time jobs to avoid working full-time for one company.</div>
                <div className='careeradvice-content'>Today, a huge proportion of people are working part-time jobs. Whatever the reason, part-time jobs have become a vital part of the workforce.</div>

                <div className='careeradvice-subtitle'>Tips for finding part-time jobs</div>
                <div className='careeradvice-content'>Finding a part-time job can be a frightening task, but with the right approach it can be a great way to earn some extra income. Here are a few tips on how to find a part-time job:</div>

                <div className='careeradvice-subtitle'>Define your goals</div>
                <div className='careeradvice-content'>Why do you want a part-time job? Do you need an additional source of money or want to gain new skills and experience? Maybe you are a student looking to earn extra money to pay for tuition and other expenses. Or maybe you are a stay-at-home parent who is looking to reenter the workforce but can only commit to working a few hours a week. Once you know your reason, you can narrow down your options.</div>
                
                <div className='careeradvice-subtitle'>Know what you are looking for</div>
                <div className='careeradvice-content'>Many industries offer part-time jobs. What type of work would you like to do? Are you seeking time flexibility or a good salary, or proximity to home? Calculate the number of hours you can work, and how much money you expect. When you have a clear idea of what you want, your job search becomes easier.</div>

                <div className='careeradvice-subtitle'>Evaluate your schedule</div>
                <div className='careeradvice-content'>When can you do a few hours of work each week? Take into account any other commitments you have, such as school or another job.</div>

                <div className='careeradvice-subtitle'>Research</div>
                <div className='careeradvice-content'>Use the internet to your advantage and search for part-time job openings on various websites. Check your local area for potential employers that offer part-time work. Check out job postings on different job boards, in newspapers, or at your local library. Ask friends and family if they know of any suitable part-time jobs. They may have heard of something that isn’t advertised anywhere.</div>
                
                <div className='careeradvice-subtitle'>Check details of the open positions and apply</div>
                <div className='careeradvice-content'>Once you find a few potential jobs, be sure to read the job descriptions carefully. Read up on the company beforehand so that you know what they do and if their values align with your own. Make sure you have all the necessary qualifications/skills for the job before applying. Many employers will require you to have relevant experience or qualifications. However, there can be certain positions that are meant for job seekers who are freshers (have no prior experience in that field.)</div>

                <div className='careeradvice-subtitle'>Prepare for an interview</div>
                <div className='careeradvice-content'>Be prepared for the interview process. Just because it’s a part-time job doesn’t mean that the employer won’t take the interview process seriously. In your resume and during your interview, highlight your preference for a part-time job to leave the impression that you are serious about it. Make sure you follow all rules of job interview etiquette.</div>

                <div className='careeradvice-subtitle'>Stay committed to the job search</div>
                <div className='careeradvice-content'>Qualifying for a part-time job requires the same amount of time and energy as qualifying for full-time employment. You may be required to apply for multiple jobs before you find one. Dedication and patience in your job search will help you land the job you seek.</div>

                <div className='careeradvice-subtitle'>Conclusion</div>
                <div className='careeradvice-content'>There are many benefits of a part-time job but finding the right one can be tricky. But with a little planning and effort, it is possible to find a part-time job that fits your needs and schedule. There are a few things to consider when looking for a part-time job, such as your schedule, location, and the type of work you want to do.
