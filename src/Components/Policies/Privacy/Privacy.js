You expressly consent to Agamemnon handling your personal data in line with this Privacy Policy by using our Sites or providing us information. Your personal information may be used by Agamemnon to complete your request, send you marketing materials, handle your job application, or administer your BeyondAgamemnon membership.

                                When you use the Sites to request information from Agamemnon or to provide information to Agamemnon, such as when you fill out a form requesting consulting expertise, agree to receive emails from Agamemnon, take surveys, join our alumni community, BeyondAgamemnon, or apply for a job at Agamemnon, Agamemnon collects personal data from you.
                                <br /><br />
                                Your name, email address, title, occupation, affiliation with a company or university, industry, region, or country are just a few examples of the personal information we may collect from you. We may also ask you for information about your interests in certain topics, any additional background data you may have included with your application, and any other details you include in messages you send us.
                                <br /><br />
                                In accordance with our cookie policy, we may also gather data on how you utilise our websites. Be aware that BeyondAgamemnon is subject to a different cookie policy, which you can read about here.

                                You voluntarily consent to Agamemnon using your personal information in the ways and for the purposes specified in this Privacy Policy by using our Sites and providing us with this information. Sending us any information that you do not want Agamemnon to use is a courtesy.
                                <br /><br />
                                In order to fulfil your request, give you the information you requested, and/or send you marketing materials, Agamemnon will use your personal data. Your data will be handled if you have applied for a position at Agamemnon in order to evaluate and process your application and candidacy for the post you have applied for. Additionally, we could use your data to offer you publications we believe would interest you and to contact with you about Agamemnon events as well as to assess and enhance our hiring and onboarding procedures. The section under "Job Applicants" has further information.
                                <br /><br />
                                For marketing and promotional reasons, Agamemnon may gather personal information and divulge it in aggregate form to third-party service providers. However, we never give these organisations any information that may be used to individually identify you in these circumstances.
                                <br /><br />
                                Your information will be processed if you sign up as a member on BeyondAgamemnon for activities like sending surveys and mailings to alumni specifically as well as keeping and distributing marketing and career development contacts. Other BeyondAgamemnon members could also be able to see your data.
                                <br /><br />
                                You are not required to give us any personal information. But if you don't, we might be unable to deal with your request or offer you the services you need.
                                <br /><br />
                                For as long as it takes to complete your request or as long as we have a business relationship with you, Agamemnon will retain your personal information. Agamemnon will retain the personal information related to your application for a position with them for up to five years.
                                <br /><br />
                                Please be aware that Agamemnon is not liable for any information you choose to make public on message boards, chat rooms, or other similar websites, including those that are hosted on or linked to our Sites. Whenever you openly provide information about yourself online (for instance, via message boards or chat rooms), you should be aware that this information might be gathered and exploited by strangers. Additionally, along with the poster's name and content, certain message boards and related user forums may also display IP addresses. If there are any message boards, chat rooms, or other user forums on the Sites, users may reveal information there. Agamemnon is not liable for any actions or policies taken by third parties who obtain this information.

                                It's possible that the businesses in the Agamemnon group and other third parties with whom we share your information are situated in nations that do not provide the same level of protection for your personal information as your own. When that occurs, Agamemnon makes sure that your personal information is secured by employing the proper legal procedures. Use of contracts or language endorsed by the European Commission is one of these techniques if you live in the European Union.
